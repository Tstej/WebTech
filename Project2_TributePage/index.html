                    <p>Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in a Punjabi Hindu family in Karnal, Haryana.
                        The youngest of four children, she was born into a conservative society, but Chawla broke
                        several
                        traditions to become the first Indian-born female astronaut. She completed her schooling from
                        Tagore Baal
                        Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. Growing up, Chawla went to local flying clubs and
                        watched planes with
                        her father.After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering
                        from Punjab Engineering College, India, Chawla moved to the United States in 1982. In 1984, she
                        graduated with a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas
                        at
                        Arlington, and went on to earn a second Master's in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in
                        1988 from
                        the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

                    <p>
                        In 1988, Chawla joined NASA's Ames Research Center, where she initially conducted computational
                        fluid dynamics research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of
                        Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined
                        Overset Methods, Inc. as vice president and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of
                        moving multiple body problems. Chawla held a Certified Flight Instructor rating for airplanes,
                        gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and
                        gliders. After she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA
                        Astronaut Corps. She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in
                        1997.

                <h3>First Space Mission of Kalpana Chawla</h3>
                <p class="box-p">Chawla's first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the six-astronaut
                    crew that flew
                    the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She
                    spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space: "You are just your
                    intelligence." Chawla had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth. On her
                    first mission, Chawla travelled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the Earth, logging more than
                    376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space. During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying
                    the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi
                    to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation exonerated[20] Chawla by identifying
                    errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control.
                    After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in
                    the astronaut office to work on the space station.</p>

                <h3>Second Space Mission and Death</h3>
                <p class="box-p">In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107. This
                    mission was
                    repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002
                    discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On 16 January 2003, Chawla finally returned
                    to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. The crew performed nearly
                    80 experiments studying Earth and space science, advanced technology development, and astronaut
                    health and safety.
                    During the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the
                    Space Shuttle external tank and struck the port wing of the orbiter. Previous shuttle launches had
                    seen minor damage from foam shedding,[22] but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia
                    was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have
                    fixed the problem if it had been confirmed.
                    When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth on 1 February 2003, the damage allowed hot
                    atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft
                    to become unstable and break apart over Texas.[24] Chawla died along with the other six crew
                    members. After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two
                    years, similar to the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. Construction of the International Space
                    Station (ISS) was put on hold; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State
                    Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 45 months for
                    crew rotation.
                    Chawla's remains were identified along with those of the rest of the crew members and were cremated
                    and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.</p>
