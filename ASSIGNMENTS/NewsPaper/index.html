            <h4>Paris Olympics 2024 Day 11 Live Updates:</h4>
            <hr>
            <h3><u>Vinesh Phogat enters semis</u></h3>
            <p>Seasoned Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat entered her maiden Olympic semifinals in the 50kg category after
                notching up stunning victories over defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan and higher-ranked Ukrainian
                Oksana Livach.

                The 29-year-old Vinesh defeated Livach, a former European champion and 2018 world championship
                bronze-medallist, 7-5 in a hard-fought quarterfinal bout to get closer to an elusive Olympic medal in
                her third attempt.

                This was after she caused the biggest wrestling upset in the ongoing Games when she shocked four-time
                world champion and reigning gold-medallist Yui Susaki of Japan on points in the pre-quarterfinals.

                Later in the evening, Vinesh will be up against Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez in the last-four stage. A
                win will assure her of at least a silver while a loss will take her into the bronze medal playoff.</p>

            <h3><u>Neeraj Chopra qualifies for final</u></h3>
            <p>Chopra's tremendous effort, which is the second best of his career, also set aside concerns surrounding
                Chopra's fitness after he revealed that he had been battling an adductor niggle in the build-up to the
                Games. His personal best continues to be 89.94m achieved back in 2022.

                Chopra, also the reigning world champion, topped the qualification round -- combined of Group A and B --
                with his monster throw. Two-time world champion Anderson Peters (88.63m) of Grenada was second in Group
                B and he was second overall also.

                Julian Weber of Germany, who won Group A with 87.76, was third overall, while reigning Commonwealth
                Games champion Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan also qualified for the finals with a throw of 86.59m in Group
                B.

                Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic, who was the only man to have beaten
                Chopra this year in Doha Diamond League, was seventh overall with a first round throw of 85.63m.

                The other Indian in fray, Kishore Jena, bowed out of contention to make the 12-man final on Thursday
                after managing a poor throw of 80.73m. He finished ninth in Group A and 18th overall.

                All those who throw 84m or above, or at least the 12 best performers from Group A and B combined will
                advance to the final. In fact nine throwers crossed the automatic final round qualification distance,
                which showed the quality of the competition.

                In the final, Chopra will have a chance to become only the fifth man in Olympic javelin throw history to
                defend the title.

                If he wins gold, and for that matter a medal, he will become the most decorated Indian in Olympics in
                individual sport.</p>

            <p>Former Bangladesh IT minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak detained by authorities at the Dhaka airport. Palak was
                attempting to flee the country when he was detained, Prothom Alo reported. This comes after Sheikh
                Hasina, resigned as Bangladesh's Prime Minister yesterday following weeks of student protests, fleeing
                to India. According to reports, after arriving at the Hindon airbase near Delhi, she is expected to
                pursue asylum in the United Kingdom.

                Earlier. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, while addressing the Parliament on Tuesday, said that
                the Indian government is closely monitoring the situation in Dhaka and engaging in ongoing discussions
                with the interim government of Bangladesh.

                The sudden resignation and departure of the former leader has cast a shadow of uncertainty over
                Bangladesh, as the country grapples with the aftermath of this significant political development.

                EAM Jaishankar on Tuesday also convened an all party meeting and briefed his colleagues over the
                situation in Bangladesh. Expressing confidence that there was near "unanimous support" cutting across
                party line, he said, "understanding that was extended" around the situation in the neighboring country.

                Hasina arrived in India in a military transport plane of Bangladesh Air Force as thousands of protesters
                stormed and vandalised 'Ganabhaban' - the official residence of the prime minister in Dhaka.</p>
